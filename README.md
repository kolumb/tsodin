[Tsoding](https://tsoding.org/) drew different emotes for his channel. And other people on his Discord channel started to draw different versions and combinations of accessories and facial features. So I took this [picture](https://www.redbubble.com/i/sticker/Nerd-by-rexim/33844918.EJUG5) and separated its features into separate layers for this generator. And as somebody came up with different idea for an emote, I tried to add it here too. I hope they don't mind <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4366033/183293593-7e1cc591-06a5-4ce0-9c3d-6812894b3324.png" alt="monkaS" width="15" height="15">
